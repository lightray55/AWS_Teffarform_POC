## Instructions to run unit tests

Firstly you will need to install jest locally. Navigate to this directory and run the following command:
`npm install --save-dev jest`

Once jest is installed run the following command:
`npm test`

All tests should be stored in the `_`_tests`_`_ folder.
Mocks for these tests should be stored in the `_`_mocks`_`_ folder.
